      <p className="about__me">
        When designing, I always try to empathize and put myself in the
        user&#39;s shoes, to show empathy. I am especially obsessed with
        interaction and small that many people might miss, but which I believe
        greatly improve the user experience. I&#39;m a firm believer that small
        details and polish matter.

        I’m always excited to collaborate with startups and founders shaping the
        future of digital products. If you’re looking to elevate your product’s
