        At Web Bunny, I focused on designing high-impact e-commerce platforms,
        SaaS products, and a Web3 crypto wallet. My role was to ensure seamless
        user experiences, drive conversion, and establish a scalable design
        system.
      </p>
      <p className="experience__text">
        I also implemented a component-based design system, reducing UI
        inconsistencies and accelerating feature development by 50%. My work at
        Web Bunny wasn&#39;t just about aesthetics—it was about making design a
        core driver of business growth.
